\textbf{Custom Cloze Test Dataset:} This dataset represents a specialized subset curated by our team, consisting of a unique compilation of 300 cloze-style questions. Each question is meticulously derived from Wikipedia articles, designed specifically to evaluate the models' capability to appropriately fill in the blanks with suitable words or phrases. The careful selection and assembly of this dataset underscore our commitment to crafting targeted assessments that directly measure the nuanced comprehension abilities of language models. This bespoke dataset serves as a cornerstone within our broader experimental framework, enabling a precise examination of model performance in tasks requiring deep linguistic understanding and contextual reasoning.
